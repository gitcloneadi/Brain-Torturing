# [Min Add to Make Parentheses Valid](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/min-add-to-make-parentheses-valid/0)
Difficulty Level : Difficulty: Medium

You are given a string 
s
 consisting only of the characters 
'('
 and 
')'
. Your task is to determine the 
minimum
 number of parentheses (either '(' or ')') that must be inserted at any positions to make the string s a valid parentheses string.


A parentheses string is considered valid if:




Every opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing parenthesis ')'.


Every closing parenthesis ')' has a corresponding opening parenthesis '('.


Parentheses are properly nested.




Examples:


Input: 
s = "(()("

Output:
 2

Explanation:
 There are two unmatched '(' at the end, so we need to add two ')' to make the string valid.


Input: 
s = ")))"

Output:
 3

Explanation: 
Three '(' need to be added at the start to make the string valid.


Input: 
s = ")()()"

Output:
 1 
Explanation: 
The very first ')' is unmatched, so we need to add one '(' at the beginning.


Constraints:
1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 10
5
s[i] ∈ { '(' , ')' }
